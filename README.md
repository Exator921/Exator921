### Howdy,
My name is Eleanor and I create bullshit code.

At the time of writing this I am a simple student learning to code and make things like games, programs, and websites.
I am trans woman and use She/Her pronouns. Though I do use them you can call me whatever you want, anything aside from He/Him at least (for obvious reasons).
